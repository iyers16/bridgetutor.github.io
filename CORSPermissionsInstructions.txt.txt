In order to get the data locally, we need to disable a security permission in the browser.
I'm not quite sure how to do this in other browsers, but in firefox this is how.

1. Type about:config and then accept the risk.
2. search for filuri
3. click on the thing that says security.fileuri... etc and set it to false.
4. Then when you lauch the index.html in firefox and check the console there shouldn't be any errors except that to do with the files formatting.
